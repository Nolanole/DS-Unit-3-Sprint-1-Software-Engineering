### Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

Q1: What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
    something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
    when others do the same for your code?

A1: An important part of code reviews is just having someone else read over your code 
    and provide a different perspective. Writing code is not just about code that works- 
    it should be logically organized and commented appropriately, leaving hints/explanations
    for others (or future you) what each section of code or each function is designed to do.
    I appreciate when others point out areas where my code could benefit from more commenting.
    Also I appreciate when they can suggest a refactoring, perhaps reduces the amount of code,
    or that augments it in some way so that it has a broader application.

Q2: We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
    slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
    improve this situation?

A2: Containers provide a sort of virtualized environment which is consistent. They can be fairly lightweight, and run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Also they come pre-loaded with the correct software dependencies and certain versions of programming languages and other software. This consistency obfuscates the headaches and frustrations that can result when code is run from different computers with different versions of programs/software etc.
